/*
	Write an echo program where you prompt the user to input a word followed by enter.
	You then print out the word under it by looping through the line buffer returned by System.in.read();

	Use only chars to achieve this i.e. no String
	And use System.in.read()
	
	Output in terminal:

		Type a word: hello
		hello

	Part 2 
	Can you create an endless loop so the echo fun never ends
