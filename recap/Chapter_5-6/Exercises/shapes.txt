In this exercise you will create classes that can hold right anngle triangles, rectangles and circles.

Rectangle
1) Create a class called Rectangle
2) When constructing a rectangle you must specify it's width and height as a decimal number. Write a constuctor that acheives this.
3) A rectangle should have a color, the user can change the color after creating the 
object. The default color should be blue.
4) A rectangle has two methods: getArea, getPerimeterLength.

Right Angle triangle
1) Create a class called RATriangle
2) When constructing a triangle you must specify it's width and height as a decimal number. Write a constuctor that acheives this.
3) A triangle has three methods: getHypotenuseLength, getPerimeterLength, getArea.

Circle.
1) Create a class called Circle
2) When defining a circle you must specify it's radius, it should be possible to se t a radius of 3.45. Write a constuctor that acheives this.
3) A circle should have a color, the user can change the color after creating the 
object. The default color should be red.
4) Circle class should have three methods: getArea, getDiameter, getCircumference
	(NB/ Math.PI is a constant you might want)

Write a program that creates a number of different shapes and writes out their properties to the console.
