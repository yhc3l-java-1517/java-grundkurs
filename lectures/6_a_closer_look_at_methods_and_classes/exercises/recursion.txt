We have a triangle made of blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such a triangle with the given number of rows. 

triangle(0) → 0
triangle(1) → 1
triangle(2) → 3
triangle(15) → ?
triangle(120) → ?
