    Exercise SquareBoard (nested-loop): Write a program called 
    SquareBoard that displays the following nxn (n=5) pattern 
    using two nested for-loops.

    # # # # #
    # # # # #
    # # # # #
    # # # # #
    # # # # # 

    Your program should use only two output statements, one EACH of the followings:
    System.out.print("# ");   // print # and a space, without newline
    System.out.println();     // print a newline

    public static void main(String args[]){
        int size = 5;    // size of the board
        for (int row = 1; /* Your code here */; /* Your code here */) {
            for (int col = 1; /* Your code here */; /* Your code here */) {
                /* Your code here */
