/*
    You are going to calculate the distance to a lightening strike based on the 
    number of seconds it takes for the sound to travel to you. Based on the fact
    that sound takes 340.29m per second.

    1) Create a class with the same name as this file
    2) Create the main method
    3) Declare three variables seconds, speed and distance choose the correct type for each
    4) Set variable speed to 340.29
    5) Set variable seconds to be any number. (this number represents how many seconds it took between you seeing the flash of lightening and hearing the bang).
    6) Set/calculate the distance variable using speed and seconds.
    7) Display the distance in the terminal.
