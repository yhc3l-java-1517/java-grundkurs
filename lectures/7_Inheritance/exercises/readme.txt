Complete exercise 2.2 on page http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3f_OOPExercises.html

Once you have completed the exercise.

1) Create an array of objects containing a number of different circles, rectangles and squares.

2) Loop through them and use the toString method to print information about each shape to the console.

3) Change the array so it contains references to the Shape class instead of the object.

4) Can you loop through the shapes and print the area to the console.

5) Declare the Shape class as abstract. Add an abstract method called getArea. 

6) Overide the equals method that is found in the Object class for each shape class so that it returns true
 when a shape with the same dimensions is compared to an identical shape with the same dimensions.
